>### Time Series Analysis on Walmart Sales

#### Business Objective
Mainly to analyze the Walmart sales data and predict their storesâ€™ sales. Also, to examine if there is seasonal sales pattern which could be beneficial for better marketing strategies. The significance of several macro-indicators like CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc. , which provided from the dataset, against the sales figure have also been examined.


#### Data Collection
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.


#### Methodoly
1. Data Preprocessing via EDA & data cleaning. <br /> 
2. Build models to predict the sales. <br /> 
3. Evaluate the models & compare their respective RMSE. <br /> 


#### Models Used
1. ARIMA <br />
